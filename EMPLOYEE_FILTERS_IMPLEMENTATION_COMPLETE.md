## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees`
2. Expand the "Filter Employees" panel
3. Test different filter combinations:
   - Select multiple departments
   - Choose different employment types
   - Filter by status
   - Set date ranges
4. Verify URL parameters update correctly
5. Test search functionality
6. Check pagination with filters

8. Verify clear all filters functionality

### Automated Verification
- Run `node verify-employee-filters.js` for logic verification
- Open `test-employee-filters.html` for implementation overview

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema Support

The implementation leverages the existing database schema:

```sql
-- Employees table structure
employees:
  - id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key to users)
  - employee_code (unique)
  - department_id (foreign key to departments)
  - job_title (string)
  - join_date (date)
  - contract_type (string)
  - status (enum: 'active', 'inactive')
  - phone, address, photo (optional fields)
```

## ðŸ”„ URL Parameter Format

The system uses a consistent URL parameter format:

```
/employees?filter_department=1,2&filter_contract_type=Permanent&filter_status=active&filter_join_date_from=2023-01-01&filter_join_date_to=2023-12-31&search=john&page=1&per_page=25
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System Compliance
