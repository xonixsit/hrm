## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CompetencyAssessmentController.php`

```php
// Added departments data to create method
$departments = \App\Models\Department::orderBy('name')
    ->get()
    ->map(function ($department) {
        return [
            'id' => $department->id,
            'name' => $department->name
        ];
    });

return Inertia::render('CompetencyAssessments/Create', [
    'employees' => $employees,
    'competencies' => $competencies,
    'assessmentCycles' => $assessmentCycles,
    'departments' => $departments  // New
]);
```

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Create.vue`

#### New Reactive Variables
```javascript
const employeeSearch = ref('');
const selectedDepartment = ref('');
const competencySearch = ref('');
const selectedCategory = ref('');
```

#### Computed Properties for Filtering
```javascript
const filteredEmployees = computed(() => {
  let filtered = props.employees;
  
  // Search filter
  if (employeeSearch.value) {
    const searchTerm = employeeSearch.value.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(employee => 
      employee.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
      (employee.position && employee.position.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm))
    );
  }
  
  // Department filter
  if (selectedDepartment.value) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(employee => 
      employee.department && employee.department.id === selectedDepartment.value
    );
  }
  
  return filtered;
});

const filteredCompetencies = computed(() => {
  let filtered = props.competencies;
  
  // Search filter
  if (competencySearch.value) {
    const searchTerm = competencySearch.value.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(competency => 
      competency.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
      (competency.description && competency.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm))
    );
  }
  
  // Category filter
  if (selectedCategory.value) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(competency => 
      competency.category === selectedCategory.value
    );
  }
  
  return filtered;
});
```

#### New Helper Methods
```javascript
const clearEmployeeFilters = () => {
  employeeSearch.value = '';
  selectedDepartment.value = '';
};

const clearCompetencyFilters = () => {
  competencySearch.value = '';
  selectedCategory.value = '';
};
```

## UI Components Added

### Filter Sections
- **Search inputs** with magnifying glass icons
- **Dropdown selectors** for department and category
- **Clear filter buttons** with X mark icons
- **Results counters** showing filtered vs total counts

### Empty States
- **No employees found** with user icon and clear action
- **No competencies found** with document icon and clear action
- **Helpful messaging** guiding users to adjust filters

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Faster Selection**: Quickly find specific employees or competencies
2. **Better Organization**: Filter by department or category for logical grouping
3. **Reduced Scrolling**: Fewer items to browse through with active filters
4. **Clear Feedback**: Always know how many options are available

4. **Performance**: Client-side filtering for instant results
