# Competency Assessment Layout Consistency - Complete

## Overview
Successfully updated all competency assessment pages to use the standardized PageLayout component for consistent theming and navigation throughout the application.

## Pages Updated

### ✅ Already Updated (from previous session)
1. **Index.vue** - Main assessments listing page
2. **Show.vue** - Assessment details view
3. **Edit.vue** - Assessment editing form
4. **Create.vue** - Assessment creation wizard
5. **Evaluate.vue** - Assessment evaluation form

### ✅ Newly Updated (this session)
6. **MyAssessments.vue** - Personal assessments dashboard
7. **EmployeeAssessments.vue** - Employee-specific assessments view
8. **Pending.vue** - Pending assessments listing

## Changes Made

### Layout Structure Updates
- Replaced custom header sections with `PageLayout` component
- Standardized breadcrumb navigation across all pages
- Unified header actions (buttons/links) using consistent patterns
- Maintained existing functionality while improving visual consistency

### Component Imports Added
```javascript
import PageLayout from '@/Components/Layout/PageLayout.vue';
```

### Computed Properties Added
Each page now includes:
- `breadcrumbs` - Hierarchical navigation path
- `headerActions` - Standardized action buttons with icons and variants

### Template Structure
**Before:**
```vue
<AuthenticatedLayout>
  <div class="py-6">
    <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
      <!-- Custom header -->
      <!-- Content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</AuthenticatedLayout>
```

**After:**
```vue
<AuthenticatedLayout>
  <PageLayout
    :title="title"
    :subtitle="subtitle"
    :breadcrumbs="breadcrumbs"
    :actions="headerActions"
  >
    <!-- Content -->
  </PageLayout>
</AuthenticatedLayout>
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Visual Consistency
- All competency assessment pages now share the same header layout
- Consistent spacing, typography, and button styling
- Unified breadcrumb navigation pattern

### 2. Improved Navigation
- Clear hierarchical breadcrumbs on every page
- Consistent "Back" and action buttons placement
- Better user orientation within the application

### 3. Maintainability
- Centralized layout logic in PageLayout component
- Easier to update styling across all pages
- Reduced code duplication

### 4. User Experience
- Familiar navigation patterns across all assessment pages
- Improved accessibility with consistent button labeling
- Better visual hierarchy with standardized headers

## Technical Details

### Breadcrumb Patterns
- **Dashboard** → **Assessments** → **[Specific Page]**
- **Dashboard** → **Assessment Dashboard** → **[Specific Page]**
- **Dashboard** → **Assessments** → **Assessment Details** → **Edit Assessment**

### Action Button Patterns
- Primary actions (Create, Submit) use `variant: 'primary'`
- Secondary actions (Back, Cancel) use `variant: 'secondary'`
- All buttons include appropriate Heroicons for visual clarity

### Icon Usage
- `ArrowLeftIcon` for back navigation
- `PlusIcon` for create/add actions
- `PencilIcon` for edit actions
- `EyeIcon` for view actions

## Quality Assurance
- ✅ All pages pass Vue template validation
- ✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- ✅ Consistent component imports
- ✅ Proper computed property definitions
- ✅ Maintained existing functionality

## Files Modified
1. `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/MyAssessments.vue`
2. `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/EmployeeAssessments.vue`
3. `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Pending.vue`

## Next Steps
The competency assessment module now has complete layout consistency. All pages follow the same design patterns and provide a cohesive user experience. The standardized layout makes it easier to:

1. Add new assessment-related pages in the future
2. Maintain consistent styling across the module
3. Implement global layout changes efficiently
4. Provide better accessibility and navigation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All competency assessment pages now use the standardized PageLayout component with consistent breadcrumbs, headers, and navigation patterns.
