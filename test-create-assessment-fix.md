# Create Assessment Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The create assessment form was showing a JSON validation error popup requiring a "rating" field, which should not be required when creating a new assessment.

## Root Cause
1. **Model Validation**: The `CompetencyAssessment` model's `validationRules()` method had `rating` as required
2. **Service Logic**: The service was trying to access `$data['rating']` without checking if it exists
3. **Controller Response**: The store method was returning JSON instead of redirecting for form submissions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Model Validation Rules
- Changed `rating` from `required` to `nullable` in base validation rules
- Added separate `submissionValidationRules()` method that requires rating
- Updated `conditionalValidationRules()` to use submission rules

### 2. Fixed Service Logic
- Updated `createAssessment()` to handle nullable rating: `$data['rating'] ?? null`
- Enhanced `validateAssessmentData()` to use appropriate validation rules based on status

### 3. Enhanced Controller Response
- Updated `store()` method to handle both JSON API requests and form submissions
- Added proper redirect response for form submissions
- Added error handling for both response types

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Creating Assessment (Draft)
- ✅ Rating is optional
- ✅ Comments are optional
- ✅ Form redirects to edit page after creation
- ✅ Assessment is created with status 'draft'

### Submitting Assessment
- ✅ Rating is required
- ✅ Comments required for ratings 1-2 or 4-5
- ✅ Assessment status changes to 'submitted'

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Create Assessment**
   - Go to Assessment Dashboard
   - Click "New Assessment" or navigate to create page

2. **Fill Required Fields Only**
   - Select Employee
   - Select Competency  
   - Select Assessment Type
   - Leave Assessment Cycle as optional
   - **Do NOT provide rating or comments**

3. **Submit Form**
   - Click "Create Assessment"
   - Should redirect to edit page (not show JSON error)
   - Assessment should be created with status 'draft'

4. **Complete Assessment**
   - On edit page, provide rating and comments
   - Click "Submit Assessment"
   - Should change status to 'submitted'

## Files Modified

- `app/Models/CompetencyAssessment.php`
- `app/Services/CompetencyAssessmentService.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/CompetencyAssessmentController.php`

## Validation Rules Summary

### Creation (Draft Status)
```php
'rating' => 'nullable|integer|between:1,5'
'comments' => 'nullable|string|max:2000'
```

### Submission (Submitted Status)
```php
'rating' => 'required|integer|between:1,5'
'comments' => 'required_if:rating,<=,2|required_if:rating,>=,4|string|max:2000'
```

The create assessment form should now work without requiring rating or showing JSON error popups.
