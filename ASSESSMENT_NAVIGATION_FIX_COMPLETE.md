# Assessment Navigation Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The assessment navigation in the Assessment Dashboard was not working due to missing page components and potential route helper issues.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Page Components**: Several navigation routes were pointing to non-existent Vue components
2. **Controller Method Issues**: Some controller methods were returning JSON responses instead of Inertia responses for navigation
3. **Route Helper Availability**: Potential issues with the route helper function not being available in the browser context

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Page Components

#### CompetencyAssessments Pages
- `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Index.vue` - Main assessments listing page
- `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Create.vue` - Create new assessment page
- `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Show.vue` - View assessment details page
- `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Edit.vue` - Edit assessment page
- `resources/js/Pages/CompetencyAssessments/Pending.vue` - Pending assessments page

#### AssessmentCycles Pages
- `resources/js/Pages/AssessmentCycles/Index.vue` - Assessment cycles listing page

#### Analytics Pages
- `resources/js/Pages/Analytics/CompetencyDashboard.vue` - Competency analytics dashboard

### 2. Fixed Controller Methods

#### CompetencyAssessmentController
- Updated `pending()` method to return Inertia response instead of JSON
- Added proper pagination and filtering for the pending assessments page

### 3. Enhanced Navigation Error Handling

#### AssessmentDashboard.vue
- Added try-catch blocks around all navigation methods
- Added error notifications for failed navigation attempts
- Added debugging information to identify route helper issues
- Added mounted hook to test route availability

### 4. Route Verification
All required routes are properly defined and available:
- ✅ `competency-assessments.index`
- ✅ `competency-assessments.pending`
- ✅ `competency-assessments.create`
- ✅ `competency-assessments.show`
- ✅ `competency-assessments.edit`
- ✅ `assessment-cycles.index`
