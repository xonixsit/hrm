# Timesheet Sync Design Document

## Overview

The Timesheet Sync feature creates a unified time tracking ecosystem that bridges the gap between daily work activities (work reports) and project-based time entries (timesheets). This system leverages the existing attendance duration calculations and extends them to provide intelligent time correlation, automated suggestions, and enhanced approval workflows.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Time Correlation Engine**: Matches work reports with timesheet entries based on date, project, and duration
2. **Sync Service**: Handles automated timesheet suggestions from work report data
3. **Approval Enhancement Module**: Enriches approval workflows with contextual time data
4. **Unified Dashboard**: Provides comprehensive view of all time tracking data
5. **Notification System**: Manages alerts for approvals, discrepancies, and reminders

### Data Flow

```
Work Reports → Time Correlation Engine → Timesheet Suggestions
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Attendance Data → Sync Service → Enhanced Approvals → Notifications
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Project Data → Unified Dashboard → Manager Review → Final Approval
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Time Correlation Engine

**Purpose**: Analyze relationships between work reports and timesheet entries

**Key Methods**:
- `correlateTimeData(date, employeeId)`: Find matching work reports and timesheets
- `detectDiscrepancies(workReport, timesheet)`: Identify hour mismatches
- `calculateProductivityMetrics(workReports)`: Generate productivity insights

**Database Tables**:
- `time_correlations`: Links work reports to timesheet entries
- `time_discrepancies`: Tracks identified mismatches for review

### 2. Sync Service

**Purpose**: Automate timesheet creation from work report data

**Key Methods**:
- `suggestTimesheetEntries(workReports)`: Generate timesheet suggestions
- `splitHoursAcrossProjects(workReport, projects)`: Distribute time by project
- `syncWorkReportToTimesheet(workReportId)`: Create linked timesheet entry

**Integration Points**:
- Work Report model: Extract project and duration data
- Timesheet model: Create suggested entries
- Project model: Validate project assignments

### 3. Approval Enhancement Module

**Purpose**: Enrich approval workflows with comprehensive time context

**Key Features**:
- Side-by-side comparison of work reports and timesheets
- Productivity metrics display during approval
- Discrepancy highlighting and resolution workflow
- Manager acknowledgment for flagged items

**UI Components**:
- Enhanced approval cards with work report context
- Discrepancy alert badges
- Productivity metric widgets
- Bulk approval with validation

### 4. Unified Dashboard

**Purpose**: Centralized view of all time tracking activities

**Dashboard Sections**:
- Pending approvals summary
- Time correlation status
- Productivity trends
- Discrepancy alerts
- Employee time tracking overview

**Filtering Capabilities**:
- Employee selection
- Date range picker
- Project filter
- Approval status filter
- Discrepancy type filter

### 5. Notification System

**Purpose**: Keep stakeholders informed of time tracking events

**Notification Types**:
- Timesheet submission alerts
- Approval reminders
- Discrepancy notifications
- Sync completion confirmations

**Delivery Channels**:
- In-app notifications
- Email alerts
- Dashboard badges

## Data Models

### TimeCorrelation Model

```php
class TimeCorrelation extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'work_report_id',
        'timesheet_id',
        'correlation_score',
        'hours_difference',
        'status'
    ];
    
    // Relationships
    public function workReport()
    public function timesheet()
}
```

### TimeDiscrepancy Model

```php
class TimeDiscrepancy extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'employee_id',
        'date',
        'work_report_hours',
        'timesheet_hours',
        'difference',
        'status',
        'manager_notes'
    ];
    
    // Relationships
    public function employee()
    public function workReports()
    public function timesheets()
}
```

### Enhanced Timesheet Model

```php
// Add to existing Timesheet model
public function workReports()
{
    return $this->hasManyThrough(
        WorkReport::class,
        TimeCorrelation::class,
        'timesheet_id',
        'id',
        'id',
        'work_report_id'
    );
}

public function hasDiscrepancies()
{
    return $this->discrepancies()->where('status', 'pending')->exists();
}
```

## Error Handling

### Correlation Failures
- **Issue**: Unable to match work reports with timesheets
- **Handling**: Log correlation attempts, provide manual linking interface
- **Recovery**: Allow managers to manually correlate entries

### Sync Conflicts
- **Issue**: Multiple timesheet suggestions for same period
- **Handling**: Present options to user, allow selection or merging
- **Recovery**: Maintain audit trail of sync decisions

### Data Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: Work report and timesheet data don't align
- **Handling**: Flag for review, require manager acknowledgment
- **Recovery**: Provide resolution workflow with notes

### Notification Failures
- **Issue**: Email or notification delivery fails
- **Handling**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Recovery**: Fallback to in-app notifications, admin alerts

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Time correlation algorithm accuracy
- Sync service logic validation
- Discrepancy detection precision
- Notification delivery confirmation

### Integration Tests
- Work report to timesheet sync flow
- Approval workflow with enhanced data
- Dashboard data aggregation
- Cross-model relationship integrity

### Feature Tests
- End-to-end sync process
- Manager approval with context
- Employee timesheet suggestion flow
- Dashboard filtering and display

### Performance Tests
- Large dataset correlation performance
- Dashboard load times with extensive data
- Notification system under load
- Sync service batch processing

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Control
- Employees can only sync their own data
- Managers can view team correlation data
- Admins have full system access
- Audit trail for all sync operations

### Privacy Protection
- Work report details visible only to authorized users
- Productivity metrics aggregated appropriately
- Personal time data protected per role permissions

### Data Integrity
- Validation of correlation accuracy
- Prevention of duplicate sync operations
- Rollback capability for sync errors
- Backup of original data before sync

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache correlation results for recent periods
- Store productivity metrics calculations
- Cache dashboard aggregations
- Preload approval context data

### Database Optimization
- Index on correlation lookup fields
- Optimize timesheet and work report queries
- Batch process sync operations
- Archive old correlation data

### Background Processing
- Queue sync operations for large datasets
- Background calculation of productivity metrics
- Scheduled correlation updates
- Async notification delivery
