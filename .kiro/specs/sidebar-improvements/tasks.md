- [ ] 7. Refactor Footer Actions and User Controls
  - Simplify footer to contain only essential actions (Settings, Logout)
  - Remove duplicate icons and redundant functionality
  - Implement distinctive styling for logout action (red color scheme)
  - Add proper error handling for settings and logout actions
  - Ensure footer actions work correctly in both collapsed and expanded states
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement Active State Management and Route Integration
  - Enhance active state detection to properly highlight current navigation section
  - Implement real-time updates when user permissions or roles change
  - Add proper integration with application routing and breadcrumb systems
  - Ensure deep linking correctly identifies and highlights appropriate sections
  - Create smooth transitions between different navigation states
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 9. Create Comprehensive Test Suite
  - Write unit tests for all navigation component functionality
  - Create integration tests for route navigation and permission filtering
  - Implement accessibility tests using automated testing tools
  - Add performance tests to ensure rendering and animation benchmarks
  - Create visual regression tests for different themes and states
  - Write end-to-end tests for complete navigation workflows
  - _Requirements: All requirements - testing coverage_

  - Add inline code comments explaining complex navigation logic
  - Create usage examples and integration guides for other developers
  - Implement TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
  - Add JSDoc comments for all public methods and properties
  - Update README with navigation component architecture and usage
  - _Requirements: Maintainability and developer experience_

- [ ] 11. Performance Monitoring and Analytics Integration

  - Add error tracking and monitoring for navigation failures
  - Create analytics events for navigation patterns and user behavior
  - Implement A/B testing infrastructure for navigation improvements
  - Add real-time monitoring dashboards for navigation health
  - _Requirements: 6.5, monitoring and analytics_

- [ ] 12. Final Integration and Polish
  - Conduct thorough cross-browser testing and fix compatibility issues
  - Perform final accessibility audit and address any remaining issues
  - Optimize for production deployment with proper build configurations
  - Create migration guide for any breaking changes
  - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
  - Conduct user acceptance testing and incorporate feedback
  - _Requirements: All requirements - final validation_
