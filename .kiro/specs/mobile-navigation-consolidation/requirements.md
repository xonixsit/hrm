# Mobile Navigation Consolidation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HR Management system currently has conflicting navigation implementations with both desktop sidebar navigation and separate mobile navigation components causing UI issues and inconsistent user experience. The current implementation shows mobile navigation elements inappropriately on desktop screens and has redundant navigation logic. This specification addresses the need to consolidate and fix the navigation system to provide a clean, consistent experience across all device types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single Navigation System Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified navigation system that handles both desktop and mobile experiences seamlessly, so that there are no conflicts or redundant components causing UI issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL use a single navigation system that adapts to different screen sizes
2. WHEN on desktop (≥1024px) THEN the system SHALL show the sidebar navigation only
3. WHEN on mobile (<1024px) THEN the system SHALL show mobile-optimized navigation only
4. WHEN switching between screen sizes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between navigation modes
5. WHEN navigation components are rendered THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting navigation elements

### Requirement 2: Clean Desktop Sidebar Experience

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want a clean sidebar navigation that doesn't show mobile navigation elements, so that I have an uncluttered and professional interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using desktop screens THEN the system SHALL show only the sidebar navigation component
2. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL NOT show any mobile navigation elements (hamburger menus, bottom navigation, mobile drawers)
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed/expanded THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without mobile navigation interference
4. WHEN desktop navigation is active THEN mobile navigation components SHALL be completely hidden
5. WHEN the desktop sidebar is rendered THEN it SHALL use the full available height without mobile navigation spacing

### Requirement 3: Proper Mobile Navigation Implementation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a mobile-optimized navigation that works well on touch devices, so that I can easily navigate the application on my phone or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile screens THEN the system SHALL show mobile-optimized navigation only
2. WHEN mobile navigation is active THEN the desktop sidebar SHALL be completely hidden
3. WHEN using mobile navigation THEN touch targets SHALL be appropriately sized (minimum 44px)
4. WHEN mobile navigation is displayed THEN it SHALL include hamburger menu, mobile drawer, and bottom navigation as appropriate
5. WHEN mobile navigation is used THEN it SHALL provide the same functionality as desktop navigation

### Requirement 4: Responsive Breakpoint Management

**User Story:** As a user switching between devices or resizing browser windows, I want the navigation to adapt appropriately without showing conflicting elements, so that I always have a clean and functional interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen width is ≥1024px THEN the system SHALL show desktop sidebar navigation
2. WHEN screen width is <1024px THEN the system SHALL show mobile navigation
3. WHEN screen size changes THEN the navigation SHALL switch modes without showing both simultaneously
4. WHEN breakpoint transitions occur THEN there SHALL be no visual glitches or overlapping elements
5. WHEN navigation mode switches THEN user state (current page, preferences) SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 5: Layout Integration and Spacing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main content area to adjust properly based on the navigation type being used, so that content is always properly positioned and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN desktop sidebar is active THEN main content SHALL adjust margin/padding to accommodate sidebar width
2. WHEN mobile navigation is active THEN main content SHALL use full width with appropriate top/bottom spacing
3. WHEN sidebar is collapsed THEN main content SHALL adjust to the collapsed sidebar width
4. WHEN mobile navigation drawer is open THEN main content SHALL be properly overlaid or pushed aside
5. WHEN navigation transitions occur THEN content layout SHALL adjust smoothly without jarring movements

### Requirement 6: Component Cleanup and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want clean, non-redundant navigation components that are easy to understand and maintain, so that future development is efficient and bug-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN there SHALL be clear separation between desktop and mobile navigation logic
2. WHEN navigation components are used THEN they SHALL not have redundant or conflicting functionality
3. WHEN navigation state is managed THEN it SHALL be centralized and consistent across all navigation types
4. WHEN navigation components are tested THEN they SHALL have clear, non-overlapping test coverage
5. WHEN navigation is debugged THEN it SHALL be easy to identify which navigation system is active and why

### Requirement 7: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation that loads quickly and performs smoothly regardless of device type, so that I can efficiently move through the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation loads THEN it SHALL render within 200ms regardless of device type
2. WHEN navigation transitions occur THEN they SHALL be smooth and not cause layout shifts
3. WHEN switching between navigation modes THEN there SHALL be no performance degradation
4. WHEN navigation is used THEN it SHALL not cause memory leaks or excessive re-renders
5. WHEN navigation components are loaded THEN they SHALL only load the necessary code for the current device type

## Success Criteria

- Zero conflicting navigation elements visible simultaneously
- Smooth transitions between desktop and mobile navigation modes
- Improved performance with reduced bundle size from component consolidation
- Cleaner codebase with reduced navigation-related bugs
- Better user experience scores across all device types
- Simplified maintenance and testing of navigation components

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of navigation visual appearance (covered in other specs)
- Advanced navigation features like search or customization
- Integration with external navigation systems
- Multi-language navigation support
- Advanced analytics for navigation usage patterns
