# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HR management system currently has critical navigation and authentication issues where users cannot access any pages except the dashboard after login. The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'auth')" indicates that authentication data is not being properly shared with Vue components, breaking the entire application navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to be able to navigate to all HR system pages without encountering JavaScript errors, so that I can access employee management, attendance, leaves, and other system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL be able to access all authenticated routes without JavaScript errors
2. WHEN a user navigates to any page in the system THEN the auth object SHALL be available in all Vue components
3. WHEN a user accesses employee, department, project, timesheet, attendance, leave, or feedback pages THEN the pages SHALL load successfully without undefined property errors
4. WHEN the application loads any authenticated page THEN the user's authentication state SHALL be properly shared via Inertia.js

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging information for authentication issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve similar problems in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication data is missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages instead of undefined property errors
2. WHEN Inertia.js shared data is not properly configured THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error information
3. WHEN Vue components expect authentication data THEN they SHALL have fallback handling for missing auth properties
4. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN developers SHALL have access to proper error traces and component state information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all navigation links and menu items to work correctly after login, so that users can efficiently use all HR system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any navigation menu item THEN they SHALL be redirected to the correct page without errors
2. WHEN a user accesses employee management features THEN all CRUD operations SHALL work properly
3. WHEN a user navigates between different HR modules THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and error-free
4. WHEN a user refreshes any page in the system THEN the page SHALL reload correctly with proper authentication context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with different roles (employee, manager, admin), I want to see appropriate navigation options and content based on my permissions, so that I can access only the features I'm authorized to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with specific roles logs in THEN they SHALL see navigation options appropriate to their permission level
2. WHEN role-based access control is applied THEN unauthorized users SHALL be properly redirected or shown appropriate messages
3. WHEN user permissions change THEN the navigation and available features SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN checking user roles in components THEN the role information SHALL be consistently available across all pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation components (NavLink, ResponsiveNavLink, DropdownLink) to properly handle Inertia.js Link properties, so that I can navigate throughout the application without encountering "Cannot read properties of null" errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation components receive method and as props THEN they SHALL properly pass these props to the underlying Inertia Link component
2. WHEN a user clicks on any navigation link THEN the link SHALL not throw "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'method')" errors
3. WHEN logout functionality is used THEN the POST method and button element type SHALL be properly handled
4. WHEN navigation components are used without method or as props THEN they SHALL use appropriate default values (method='get', as='a')

**Error Context:** This requirement addresses the specific error:
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'method')
    at setup (link.ts:182:64)
```
This error occurred because navigation components weren't properly accepting and forwarding the `method` and `as` props to Inertia.js Link components.
