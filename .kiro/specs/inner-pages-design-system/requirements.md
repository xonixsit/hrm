# Inner Pages Design System Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a consistent, modern, and user-friendly design system for all inner pages within the application. The current inner pages lack proper headers, consistent theming, and cohesive layout structure. This design system will address these issues by implementing Human Factor International Standards and modern UX principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Page Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want all inner pages to have a consistent structure and layout, so that I can navigate and understand the interface intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to any inner page THEN the page SHALL display a consistent header structure with breadcrumbs, page title, and action buttons
2. WHEN I view any inner page THEN the page SHALL follow a standardized layout grid with proper spacing and alignment
3. WHEN I access different sections THEN the navigation and content areas SHALL maintain consistent positioning and behavior
4. WHEN I interact with page elements THEN they SHALL follow consistent interaction patterns and visual feedback

### Requirement 2: Modern Header System

**User Story:** As a user, I want every inner page to have a clear, informative header, so that I always know where I am and what actions are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any inner page THEN the page SHALL display a page header with the current page title
2. WHEN I navigate through the application THEN the header SHALL show breadcrumb navigation indicating my current location
3. WHEN page-specific actions are available THEN the header SHALL display relevant action buttons in a consistent location
4. WHEN I need to navigate back THEN the header SHALL provide clear navigation options
5. WHEN the page has multiple sections THEN the header SHALL include tab navigation where appropriate

### Requirement 3: Responsive Layout Framework

**User Story:** As a user, I want inner pages to work seamlessly across all devices, so that I can access the application from any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access pages on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt to smaller screens with touch-friendly interactions
2. WHEN I view pages on tablets THEN the layout SHALL optimize for medium screen sizes with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN I use desktop browsers THEN the layout SHALL utilize available space efficiently with proper content organization
4. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN the layout SHALL respond smoothly without breaking or overlapping content
5. WHEN I interact with elements on touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL meet minimum 44px touch target requirements

### Requirement 4: Consistent Theming and Visual Identity

**User Story:** As a user, I want all inner pages to follow the same visual theme and design language, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN all pages SHALL use consistent color schemes, typography, and spacing
2. WHEN I interact with form elements THEN they SHALL follow standardized styling and behavior patterns
3. WHEN I view data tables and lists THEN they SHALL use consistent formatting and interaction patterns
4. WHEN I encounter loading states THEN they SHALL use standardized loading indicators and skeleton screens
5. WHEN I see error or success messages THEN they SHALL follow consistent notification patterns

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and Usability Standards

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all inner pages to be fully accessible, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use screen readers THEN all page elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
2. WHEN I navigate using keyboard only THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation
3. WHEN I have visual impairments THEN the pages SHALL provide sufficient color contrast and alternative text for images
4. WHEN I use assistive technologies THEN the page structure SHALL be properly announced and navigable
5. WHEN I need to focus on content THEN the focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible and follow logical tab order

### Requirement 6: Performance and Loading Standards

**User Story:** As a user, I want inner pages to load quickly and perform smoothly, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to any inner page THEN the page SHALL load within 2 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN pages are loading THEN they SHALL display appropriate loading states and skeleton screens
3. WHEN I interact with page elements THEN the responses SHALL be immediate with proper feedback
4. WHEN pages contain large datasets THEN they SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth without jarring layout shifts

### Requirement 7: Content Organization and Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want page content to be well-organized and easy to scan, so that I can quickly find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any page THEN the content SHALL be organized using clear visual hierarchy with proper headings
2. WHEN I scan page content THEN important information SHALL be prominently displayed using appropriate typography
3. WHEN I need to find specific information THEN the page SHALL use consistent patterns for grouping related content
4. WHEN I view forms or data entry pages THEN the fields SHALL be logically grouped and clearly labeled
5. WHEN I encounter complex information THEN it SHALL be broken down into digestible sections with clear relationships

### Requirement 8: Interactive Elements and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when I interact with page elements, so that I understand the results of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback indicating their interactive state
2. WHEN I click buttons or links THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and loading states when appropriate
3. WHEN I submit forms THEN I SHALL receive clear confirmation or error messages with specific guidance
4. WHEN I perform actions that affect data THEN I SHALL receive appropriate success or failure notifications
5. WHEN I need to confirm destructive actions THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation dialogs

### Requirement 9: Search and Filtering Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent search and filtering options across pages with data, so that I can quickly find relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view pages with searchable content THEN they SHALL provide a prominent search interface
2. WHEN I need to filter data THEN the pages SHALL offer relevant filtering options with clear labels
3. WHEN I apply filters or search THEN the results SHALL update immediately with clear indication of applied filters
4. WHEN I want to clear filters THEN there SHALL be an obvious way to reset to the default view
5. WHEN I search or filter THEN the system SHALL remember my preferences during the session

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Empty States

**User Story:** As a user, I want helpful guidance when pages have errors or no content, so that I understand what happened and what I can do next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages encounter errors THEN they SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
2. WHEN pages have no content to display THEN they SHALL show helpful empty states with guidance for next steps
3. WHEN I encounter form validation errors THEN they SHALL be clearly highlighted with specific correction guidance
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the pages SHALL provide appropriate offline or connectivity messages
5. WHEN I lack permissions for certain actions THEN the pages SHALL clearly explain the restrictions and alternatives
