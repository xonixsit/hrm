# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HR management system currently has inconsistent page layouts across different modules, including the Dashboard and Leave Management pages. While some pages use the modern PageLayout design system with proper headers, titles, and subtitles, others like the Dashboard still use older layout patterns. This creates a fragmented user experience where users encounter different header structures, spacing, and visual hierarchy depending on which page they're viewing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user navigating through different HR modules, I want all pages to have consistent page headers with clear titles and descriptive subtitles, so that I can easily understand what section I'm in and what functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any HR module page THEN they SHALL see a consistent page header with a clear title
2. WHEN a user views any page header THEN it SHALL include a descriptive subtitle explaining the page's purpose
3. WHEN a user accesses Employees, Projects, Attendance, or Feedback pages THEN the header SHALL match the design pattern used in Leave Management
4. WHEN a user views any page THEN the header SHALL be visually consistent with proper typography, spacing, and layout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages to have consistent breadcrumb navigation, so that I can understand my current location in the application hierarchy and easily navigate back to previous sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any inner page THEN they SHALL see breadcrumb navigation showing their current path
2. WHEN a user clicks on any breadcrumb item THEN they SHALL be navigated to that section
3. WHEN breadcrumbs are displayed THEN they SHALL follow a consistent visual design across all pages
4. WHEN a user is on a top-level page THEN the breadcrumb SHALL show "Dashboard > Current Page"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent action button placement and styling across all pages, so that I can quickly find and use primary actions like "Add Employee", "Create Project", etc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any list page THEN primary action buttons SHALL be positioned consistently in the top-right area
2. WHEN action buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent styling, colors, and iconography
3. WHEN multiple actions are available THEN they SHALL be grouped logically with proper spacing
4. WHEN a user hovers over action buttons THEN they SHALL provide consistent visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent content area styling and spacing across all pages, so that the application feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any page content THEN it SHALL use consistent padding, margins, and background colors
2. WHEN content cards or sections are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the same visual design patterns
3. WHEN tables or lists are shown THEN they SHALL use consistent styling and spacing
4. WHEN forms are displayed THEN they SHALL follow consistent layout and styling guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable page layout components, so that I can easily maintain consistency and reduce code duplication across different pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new pages THEN developers SHALL use standardized page layout components
2. WHEN page headers are needed THEN a reusable PageHeader component SHALL be available
3. WHEN breadcrumbs are required THEN a reusable BreadcrumbNavigation component SHALL be available
4. WHEN action buttons are needed THEN standardized ActionBar components SHALL be available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent empty states and loading states across all pages, so that I have a predictable experience when pages are loading or have no content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is loading THEN it SHALL display a consistent loading state design
2. WHEN a page has no content THEN it SHALL show a consistent empty state with helpful messaging
3. WHEN error states occur THEN they SHALL be displayed consistently across all pages
4. WHEN loading or empty states are shown THEN they SHALL match the overall design system
