# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The employee table layout is displaying with dark theme styling even when the application should be in light mode. This is causing poor visibility and user experience issues. The table appears dark with light text, making it difficult to read employee information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the employee management page, I want the table to display in the correct theme (light by default), so that I can easily read and interact with employee data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the employee index page loads THEN the table SHALL display with light theme styling by default
2. WHEN no theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL default to light theme
3. WHEN the theme toggle is used THEN the table SHALL properly switch between light and dark themes
4. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the table SHALL maintain the correct theme state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent theme application across all data tables, so that the interface remains cohesive and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any data table component THEN it SHALL respect the current theme setting
2. WHEN the theme is changed THEN all data tables SHALL update their appearance immediately
3. WHEN the system theme preference changes THEN data tables SHALL adapt accordingly
4. WHEN theme classes are applied THEN they SHALL not conflict with component-specific styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to be robust and prevent styling conflicts, so that components display correctly regardless of theme state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme system initializes THEN it SHALL properly detect and apply the correct theme
2. WHEN theme classes are missing or incorrect THEN the system SHALL fallback to light theme
3. WHEN multiple theme classes are present THEN the system SHALL clean up conflicting classes
4. WHEN theme changes occur THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be updated correctly
