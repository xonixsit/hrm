# Product Overview

This is a Laravel-based web application with a modern frontend stack. The application appears to be a business management system with features for:

- User authentication and authorization (using Laravel Sanctum)
- Role-based permissions (Spatie Laravel Permission)
- Project management
- Leave management
- Feedback system
- Document generation (PDF exports via DomPDF)
- Excel import/export functionality

The application follows a single-page application (SPA) architecture using Inertia.js to bridge Laravel backend with Vue.js frontend, providing a seamless user experience without traditional page refreshes.
